Even after years of war, the Republic boasts that they have suffered zero casualties. However, the battlefield bathed in crimson recites a different melody...  The hand dealt to the Colorata people—a minority forced into living in the \"nonexistent\" 86th district—is one of utter contempt and scorn. Looked upon as human filth, they are ordered to pilot the Juggernauts as Processors under the command of Republican Handlers.  Vladilena Milizé, a republican soldier with a strong sense of justice, detests the way her countrymen treat the 86. When she is assigned to the Spearhead Squadron as their handler, she meets a group of oddballs and eventually grows attached to them—particularly their captain, Shinei Nouzen, a boy with a pure sense of purpose and resolve. However, the path they walk is one riddled with death, and growing close to an 86 may have just set Vladilena down a path of despair.

Following the backlash caused by his supposedly tone-deaf portrayal of his mother's death, Yuuta trudges to the hospital roof to take his own life—but there, he meets a girl named Eri. Captivated by his film, Eri requests Yuuta to make a new  one that will blow the previous out of the water and prove his critics wrong. The movie they set out to make will stand apart by blurring the line between fact and fiction. And of course, it wouldn't be a Yuuta film if it didn't have his personal flavor—just a dash of fantasy.

Commanding thousands of warships and millions of soldiers, they lead giant space fleets into battle on behalf of the two interstellar states that have wrested for control of the Milky Way for over a century and a half.   The Galactic Empire, an absolute monarchy ruled by Kaiser Friedrich von Goldenbaum IV and an entrenched nobility, seeks to suppress the rebels daring to oppose the inviolable crown. The Free Planets Alliance, a representative democracy led by a corrupt High Council, degenerates as its elected leaders⁠ use war and conflict as a way to win popular support.

On opposite sides of the galaxy, the two men have wildly different visions for the future: Reinhard dreams of uniting mankind under his iron fist, while Yang wants only to carve a path to lasting peace. As the war rages on, Reinhard and Yang each strive for their ideals and secure their place among the stars as the leaders of a new era of galactic heroes.

Prior to the traffic accident, she originally had two personalities, a male personality named Shiki (織), and the original female personality Shiki (式). Children born into the Ryougi family are generally male and are raised with two personalities, so the male personality is customarily called the \"yang\" personality, while the female is called the \"yin\" personality. It is easy to tell which Shiki is speaking at a given time because they both have a distinct style of speaking, most notably that the female Shiki refers to herself with the pronoun watashi (私), while male Shiki refers to himself as ore (俺). After waking from her coma, Shiki discovers that she can no longer feel the male Shiki's presence and assumes that he died because of the accident. She also feels a detachment from her memories before the accident, and while she knows she is Shiki, she does not feel that she is. In the hopes of regaining herself and the \"dead\" Shiki, she puts on a cold facade that somewhat resembles the male Shiki's and tries to act as the female Shiki did. Touko understands the sense of detachment Shiki feels, but considers the current Shiki a third, new personality.

Gen Nakaoka is a spirited six-year-old boy who lives with his poor yet loving family in wartime Hiroshima. As the second World War rages on, Gen's father Daikichi stands among the few outspoken who are opposed to the emperor and stand for the innocent civilians bearing the brunt of the war. However, in a society with nothing but feverous support for their nation, Gen and his family are ostracized as traitors. Unbeknownst to them, a terrible fate awaits the people of Hiroshima...  One quiet morning, the US forces drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. In an instant, the city is completely destroyed, leaving thousands dead and many more exposed to radiation. Though Gen manages to survive the blast, he finds his life irreversibly changed. Regrouping with what's left of his family, Gen must now grapple with starvation, destitution, and an unsympathetic public who see survivors as little more than disease-ridden beggars.  Based on author Keiji Nakazawa's real-life experiences,  Hadashi no Gen  follows Gen and his fellow survivors in their struggle to survive in post-war Hiroshima. Gen resolves to soldier on with unwavering determination, while never forgiving those who caused the atrocity, never forgetting the pain of the bomb, and never letting his spirit be broken by the tragedy.

Spoken in fearful whispers, the word \"Yoma\" cuts a clear image into the minds of all: monstrous beings with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. But fear of their gruesome appetite is dwarfed by that of their ability to shapeshift and steal the memories of their last meal. Forever vulnerable to attack, humans live in unease, even among family.  There are few means to kill a Yoma. The Organization, informally known as \"Claymore,\" is humanity's only line of defense, dispatching half-human, half-Yoma female warriors to purify villages of Yoma. A lonely and dangerous existence, death for these warriors comes with each new assignment. What time is found between trying battles and long, arduous travels is spent in ever-intensifying struggle to resist their Yoma blood and maintain their humanity. Villagers, knowing of this, pay for their security reluctantly and have only loathsome regard for their protectors.   Claymore  follows the stoic and low-ranking member Clare in her daunting trek as she searches for personal vengeance. Along the way, she encounters many unexpected things about the world, from the camaraderie and hope held fast by her sisters-in-arms to the sinister truth behind the Claymore Organization.

In a single day, he took out the school's top thug and became the new guardian. Now, the entire school is at his mercy, and anyone who dares to challenge him better be ready to meet their maker... or so the stories go.  The truth is that all of the terrible rumors surrounding Seiichirou are misunderstandings, many assuming the worst about him because of his demon-like features.

Vash does not clearly remember the destruction of July, and only wants \"love and peace\", as he puts it; though he is a gunfighter of inhuman skill, he uses his weapons only to save lives wherever he can.

If a person is forced to betray their moral code, does that betrayal invalidate that moral code, and can the person still try to live up to that moral code? Can the person find redemption from their wrongs, and if so, how?

This spur-of-the-moment decision marks the beginning of Takumi's high-octane journey, shifting from his daily deliveries to becoming the greatest drift racer ever. Along the way, he slowly finds and kindles his love for street racing as he comes face-to-face with a plethora of opponents, each ready to take on the renowned Ghost of Akina.

Whenever she is not working, she can be seen hanging out with her friends, taking care of her younger siblings, or annoying her math teacher. However, while she lives the fairly run-of-the-mill life of a teenager, she is no stranger to the paranormal and unexplained.  Sprinkled in with Hotori's everyday antics are occasional run-ins with the supernatural—including taking an unexpected tour of Heaven, discovering a ray gun that creates giant holes, and accidentally interfering in a dispute between some aliens. In addition, she tends to spontaneously investigate cases that strike her fancy, like uncovering the true purpose of some paintings left in a will, identifying a strange man walking the hospital grounds, and going on a treasure hunt in a far-off village.  Hotori manages to find herself in the middle of some strange circumstances, and yet the town moves on in spite of the oddity of it all.

But Mami is also a special case among magical girls—while most fight for their own sake, Mami prefers to work with others, becoming a guardian of justice who destroys any evil creatures she can find, whether it be a witch or a mere familiar. It is this selfless lack of self-interest that often distances her from other magical girls, and as a result, Mami is often lonely.  During one of her usual witch hunts, she finds a novice magical girl struggling against a particularly strong witch. After Mami lends her help, the magical girl introduces herself as Kyouko Sakura from the city of Kazamino. Impressed by Mami's skill and hospitality, Kyouko quickly requests to team up with her and become her apprentice.

When one of the male leads acquired a rare pink diamond for the heroine, Mia Binoche, Deborah's envy sparked an abusive campaign that eventually landed her in an isolated monastery.

But if Deborah, as a noble lady, refuses to marry, she will meet the same pitiful ending regardless. To secure her independence, Deborah needs money and help—and a mysterious hooded information broker may prove to be her lifeline.

But everything goes south on the day Jeha is supposed to confess his feelings, for he turns into a disfigured zombie and bites Chaerin.  Instead of dying, Chaerin is forced to relive the same day, trapped in the loop of a bizarre zombie outbreak, unable to save Jeha.

Wanting to learn more about Harvey, Kieli decides to accompany him in fulfilling his promise to the Corporal, the spirit of a soldier who died in the War and has since been possessing a radio—the promise to reunite him with his mortal remains.  Throughout their journey, Kieli discovers that beyond Harvey's seemingly ruthless nature lies a kind and thoughtful man tormented by the horrors of war. As the two begin to interact and grow closer, they will develop a bond that they can forever cherish, and Harvey may finally find the warmth that he once lost.

The Japanese Self-Defense Force decided to send a small group, led by a soldier who's also an otaku, into the other world on a reconnaissance mission. They're meant to learn what they can about the empire (and its plans), the world, and the people.  They're hardly in the world yet, though, when they come across a village destroyed by a giant fire-breathing dragon. The only survivor is an unconscious elven girl they find hidden in a well. Now they feel like they must warn the nearby towns about the dragon, and do what they can to help. On the way, they'll meet more magical, female companions, and learn more about this dangerous new world.

The name of this island is Malynera, and its king is only a child.  Patalliro the 8th, King of Malynera, is ten-years-old. From the day he was born, everyone knew he was... unusual. He is a hyper boy, with flashes of genius, moments of thoughtless cruelty, and the ability to make a bad pun out of anything. Smart, but only a child and so he often does very stupid things.  Patalliro! is his story.  He lives in a world very similar to our own, but where the bizarre is commonplace. He manages to get into all kinds of trouble, from international terrorists, to space aliens, to accidental time-travel. His first challenge as king is to stay alive, when a group called the International Diamond Syndicate decides that they want control of the Malynera diamond mines. This is how he meets Bancoran, who was assigned to be his bodyguard during a trip to Britain. It's also how they meet Maraich, who was one of the assassins sent by the IDS.  Patalliro is almost always accompanied by his army of Tamanegi (\"Onions,\" so-called because of their onion-shapped wigs). The Tamanegi all wear identical masks, wigs, and glasses, and are known only by numbers. They are Patalliro's protectors, but protect the world from him just as much as they protect him from the world.

But her impression of Origichi had been that she kept to herself and was unnoticeable, and as such, her life must also have been unremarkable.  After the funeral, Suga is approached by Origuchi's mother, who mistakenly assumes that the two girls were best friends. The elder Origuchi wants to know about an ex-boyfriend that her daughter stubbornly tried to keep secret only years ago; apparently, Origuchi aborted their child before she became ill. Suga agrees to investigate this mystery, gradually gaining the assistance of former upperclassman Takashi Yanai, class celebrity Madoka Setouchi, faithful tag-along Remi Nishida, and enigmatic playboy Hikaru Narumi.  Although Suga was not close with Origuchi when she was alive, she is strangely determined to know the other girl better after her death. She starts to piece together the events that happened in their second year of high school. As Suga seeks the truth from those suspected to be involved with Origuchi, she must learn how to open up to others and be more honest herself.

Barbarians were viewed as useless in all but combat, and those who didn't fight were unable to survive. If someone couldn't pay the exorbitant taxes imposed by the city, they faced the death penalty for tax evasion.  If it's discovered that a player possesses the character they're playing, they're labelled an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Hansoo to survive is to venture into the labyrinth and risk his life in battle. Armed with his accumulated skills from nine years of gameplay and a stupidly strong barbarian physique, he strives to survive in this game.

Soon, her grades start to suffer, and the gap between the two friends continually widens until Satoko is at her breaking point.

Determined to survive the repeated attacks on himself, Ichirou makes a deal with Bloody, who he renames \"Mary\"—until the day comes that Ichirou can fulfill Mary's death wish, the vampire must do everything he can to protect this single human.

This is characteristic of Maria—despite her angelic appearance, she will tell the unadorned truth regardless of social niceties, and as such, people often compare her to a devil.  On her first day, Maria is introduced to Yuusuke Kanda and Shin Meguro, two unlikely friends. Yuusuke pretends to be cheerful and fun-loving, but in reality, he is uninterested in many things and people. In contrast, Shin acts cold and distant, but can secretly be quite caring.   Yuusuke proposes to Maria that she should put a \"lovely spin\" on the things she says to make her words sound less harsh, even if her message remains the same. Unfortunately, Maria cannot master this \"lovely spin\" when speaking, but people seem to be touched by her voice when she sings.

While Hinako is a rather happy-go-lucky girl that drives ferraris without a care for the rules of the road (or gravity, for that matter), Kuroko—who Hinako affectionately addresses as \"Kuu-chan\"—is more of a lascivious lesbian with razor sharp instincts and an impressive aptitude for murder.  The two seem like the most unlikely of duos.

After finally settling the feud with his demonic father Yuujirou, Baki defends his title in the Kourakuen Underground Arena while stifling yawns brought about by the ease with which he defeats his challengers. Baki's friends and mentors also struggle with this new peaceful stasis, completing great feats of strength training with little enthusiasm.  Soon, Japan is shaken by the reveal of a long-gestating science experiment that results in the successful cloning of legendary samurai Musashi Miyamoto. The famed warrior relishes in testing his strength against Baki and the other fighting icons of Tokyo, but he struggles to assimilate with the modern era. Miyamoto clings to his ancient ideals of honor and dueling to the death, a philosophy that clashes with the more tranquil present.  As the resurrected swordsman attempts to rise to the top of this unfamiliar society by cutting through Baki's friends, he finds himself on a collision course with the vengeful teenager.

Picasso questions why he survived the fatal crash, barely scathed, while Chiaki suffered the worst possible fate. But as all hope seems lost, Picasso—remembering that Chiaki left him something right before her death—reaches into his pocket  and pulls out a miniature Chiaki! The tiny version of his deceased friend explains to him that he should have also died in the accident, but due to her prayers, God allowed Picasso to live on the condition that he uses his artistic talents and newfound powers of seeing deeper into people's problems to help others in need.  Faced with death unless he complies, Picasso soon agrees to the terms.

All that comes out is a strong negative reaction from his parents, especially his anti-otaku policeman father.

However, despite her best efforts, her grades are middling, she has no friends, and her appearance is average at best.  On a whim, Yeseul goes to a makeup parlor, hoping to resemble Joo Heewon, the most gorgeous girl at her school, even a little bit. Her hopes are dashed, however, when the result is unfitting and clownlike. At the same time, Cheon Yuseong, a genius makeup artist, is searching for the perfect canvas. After a chance encounter, an unlikely partnership is formed between the two—a plain girl and a young genius—as they team up to compete in the televised competition known as \"Face Off Cinderella.\"   The odds are not in their favor; ruthless competitors, Heewon herself, and greedy corporate executives all stand in the pair's way. If Yeseul and Yuseong are to win, they will have to truly stand out from the crowd and show that makeup isn't for the sake of others—it is meant to be for yourself and yourself alone.

Unbeknownst to him, the one thing Mahiru should not do is say Kuro's name aloud, but he does exactly that.

Magic abilities appear almost exclusively among young women, and usually disappears with age. However, these abilities are generally limited to raising a simple protective magic field, or moving objects slightly at a distance, or for some, flying on a broom. Then, in the 16th and 17 centuries, humanity entered into an age of discovery, highlighted by the Britannian witch Jamie Watt's invention of the magic engine, a steam-powered mechanical device which could boost a witch's natural magic powers several times over, which could then be used to drive all types of machinery. The magic engine was soon put to use in all forms of industry and transport, increasing production to levels previously thought impossible.  However, together with this huge increase in magic usage, sightings of the Neuroi, enigmatic lifeforms which had been spotted on scarce occasions for centuries, also began to increase exponentially. Appearing in countries all over the world, the Neuroi spread a noxious miasma, putrefying the land and consuming all types of metals, and they began encroaching on human territory. Normal soldiers could do nothing against that miasma, and humanity was on its last legs, with no choice but to retreat time and time again. It was then that it was discovered that a witch's protective field could block the miasma, and with the power of a magic engine, witches joined the battlefield. With the ability to easily wield weapons which would normally be far too heavy, imbue their attacks with magic, fly through the air freely, and block enemy attacks with magic fields, witches began to turn the tide against the Neuroi invasion. These witches, together with the Striker Units they wore, were known as \"Strike Witches\".  In 1939, as the European mainland faced the crisis of a Neuroi invasion of unprecedented scale, Imperial Army and Navy Witches from the far off Fuso Empire were sent to the battlefield as volunteer soldiers. One such Imperial Army Witch, Anabuki Tomoko, an ace and hero to the people after her outstanding service during the Neuroi raid known as the \"Fuso Sea Incident\", had been expecting to be sent to Karlsland, where the heaviest fighting was going on. However, she was instead deployed to the northernmost extreme of Europe, Suomus. There she meets the rest of her future fellow squadron members, none of whom had ever made a name for themselves in their former countries, instead being treated nearly like outcasts, half-baked witches without any talent or motivation. It's now up to the \"Misfits Squadron\", or officially the \"Suomus Independent Volunteer Air Squadron\", to find out how they can stand up to the Neuroi menace.

Distraught, Randou crosses paths with Rina and is mistaken for her twin sister Yuna, who fled from her house two years ago. Although Randou initially wished to restore his face, seeing Rina elated makes him reconsider his decision.  However, a boy disguising himself as a girl is as absurd as it sounds, and being surrounded by troublesome individuals only makes it more difficult. Nevertheless, Randou is adamant about concealing his identity until he finds the real Yuna.

Even without disclosing her secret hobbies, Yaya is treated poorly by Seri and Moe, two mean girls who she calls friends. As hard as she tries to remain optimistic, Yaya is painfully aware that no one at school speaks to her besides her bullies and an almost offensively straightforward male classmate named Moriyama.

Moriyama encounters Nana more than once, and as he sees Yaya in class every day, he gradually begins to suspect that these two vastly different girls are the same person!

When the traders arrived in Greece to sell the female slaves, a young handsome man named Mateus bought her and promised to give her true freedom. He hired countless teachers, scholars, and palace ladies to train her into the one perfect woman of her time.  Mateus's kindness has caused Alexandra to deeply fall in love with him, and she secretly wishes to be his concubine. But cruel fate! Mateus has already promised her to his best friend, who is Suleiman the Great, Emperor of the Ottoman Empire! Mateus promised Alexandra of true freedom, but where is freedom when she is in another man's harem and can only look at the one she loves from afar?  Not willing to endure this agony, Alexandra promises herself that one day, she will free both of them from their bird cages. But Mateus is the Grand Vizier, a power only second to the Emperor himself. So Alexandra must become the most influential concubine in order to have any hope—which also means bearing Suleiman's son. However, Suleiman already has a son by another concubine, and this woman is determined to keep her son as the only prince and only heir.  Thus begins the story of a slave that becomes the story of one of the greatest empresses of all time, Alexandra, the woman who would one day be known as Roxelana, Empress of the Ottoman Empire.

His life consisted of misfortune after misfortune, culminating in an unlucky death during an incident on a school boat trip, trying to save a girl he barely knew. After death, he met a god of reincarnation who requested that the hundred or so dead passengers—one of them being the girl he tried in vain to save—be reincarnated into another world.  Yet a series of unfortunate events forced Hiroto to reincarnate with even less luck than before, starting with nothing but a tremendous amount of Mana. His second life, far worse than his first, came to a cruel end.  However, upon meeting the god a second time, he was informed that there would be yet another reincarnation—one that had already been set in motion and could not be stopped. Not wanting Hiroto to endure a third life filled with suffering, the god cursed him before he was reborn in the hopes that he would either die quickly or commit suicide.  Hiroto was reborn once more as a half-vampire, half-dark elf. A dhampir. Not wanting a fourth life, he is determined to live this third life with the only things remaining from his previous lives—Death Magic and his enormous Mana pool.

From a young age, Shizuku has been subjected to strange education from his father all for the sake of wine.

Discontent with his father, he leaves home to become an average sales representative for a beer company, refusing to ever touch wine again.  When his father suddenly passes away, Shizuku finds himself being dragged back into the world he hates so much. As part of his father's will, the one who will inherit his prized wine collection and estate will be the person who can correctly identify the \"12 Apostles\" of wines as well as the legendary \"Drops of God.\" In order to inherit the assets, Shizuku has one year to complete the task, but he finds the proposition ridiculous when he is the only living relative of Yutaka.  What Yutaka failed to tell his son before his death was that he had adopted Issei Tomine into the family a week prior to his passing. Issei is a famous veteran wine critic competing against Shizuku to claim the estate for himself. With no formal training in wine tasting, Shizuku stands no chance against \"The Prince of Wine\" and is at risk of losing everything in this competition. Will he be able to correctly identify the elusive \"Drops of God\" before he runs out of time?

He was fathered by Shiro and mothered by Yamabuki. Shiro's owner, Gohei, pays no attention to Riki when he comes to pick a pup from the litter. Instead, Riki is never rehomed and becomes close to his mother. Unfortunately, Yamabuki's true owner, who had been sick, was healthy enough to take her back. She didn't feel she could handle two dogs, and decided that he would not take Riki in. Riki severely missed his mother, and one day set out to meet her. On his way, he is attacked by a pack of dogs. Hopelessly outnumbered, Riki tries to escape and falls into a river. Waking up, he learns that his father, Shiro, has rescued him. Riki had never seen his father, but had known his name. Shiro, on the other hand, didn't know that Riki was his son and left before Riki could say anything. But, not before giving him a speech on being strong. Riki makes it his goal and constantly tries to get stronger.  One day, a child named Daisuke takes a toy car (one children can ride in) through a roaded mountain pass with an incline. Riki, while traveling to see his mother, notices him racing down. A truck, not seeing Daisuke, hits the boy and sends him flying over the road railing. Afraid that he is dead, the driver moves on. Daisuke, although only bruised, is knocked out. Riki jumps onto a ledge and howls, hopeing someone would hear. Instead, the pack that attacked him heard him and came. After being abused, the pack came to hate humans and attacked Daisuke. Riki, in an effort to save him, fought against the dogs and succeeded in winning. Gohei and Shiro eventually showed up, and the pack ran off. Shiro finally found out that Riki was his son.  Gohei, Shiro, and a few others head out to fight Akakabuto. Seeing this, Riki follows the van. Gohei intends to kill Akakabuto, but the bear is too strong. Gohei shot the bear in the eye, and the bullet became lodged in the beast's brain. This made him go insane and, while biting Shiro, fall over a cliff. Riki witnessed all this, and was distraught when his father fell. These events set the stage for the future series, Ginga Nagareboshi Gin.

(The project was never commercialized).  These events inspired Tezuka Osamu to craft the story of a fictitious secret weapon, Big X, which he portrays as jointly developed by Japan and Germany.  \"Big X\" was also produced for television in cartoon form, and both the Manga and made-for-TV animation versions became huge hits. Tezuka Osamu, however, was not too attached to his character Akira Asagumo, who came to represent an overly righteous hero trumpeting justice.  Despite such sentiment on the part of the author, the work became a leading satirical Manga, realistically depicting the terror of the war. No one else but Tezuka Osamu, who witnessed the war himself, could have produced such an effective piece of work.

But when a woman is reincarnated into the story as Yerenika, she resolves to change her terrible fate and escape death. Unexpectedly, she has joined the narrative at an earlier point in time—both the main characters and the villain have yet to be born!  Yerenika successfully derails the story from its intended course by preventing the abduction of her sister Theresia by Euredian, the king of Bellecourt—a plot point that would have set a series of tragic events in motion. However, Yerenika's plan goes awry when Euredian kidnaps her instead and takes her to his nation. Given that the air of Bellecourt is thick with magic and toxic to Yerenika's weak body, she resorts to her final strategy.  Originally, Euredian went on to marry Lady Soleia Elodia and father Dekalb, the villain of the web novel who led an entire slew of characters to their deaths. Now, Yerenika must rewrite history and prevent Dekalb from ever existing—by seducing his father and making Euredian marry her instead!

While searching for any outstanding clues, the girl shows Kaoru a photo of the person she is looking for.

This is only complicated by the different women that Kaoru finds himself surrounded by. Even so, Kaoru and Aoi wish to learn more about each other and stay together against their families' wishes.
